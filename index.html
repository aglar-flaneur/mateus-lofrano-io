            <div class="case-card">
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Behavior Score and Rollover Prediction for Volkswagen Truck and Bus</h3>
                <p>Developed predictive models for rollover risks, <strong>achieving 92% accuracy</strong> by leveraging advanced neural networks trained on telemetry data. The feature uses telemetry readings to create proxies for vehicle inclination, enabling real-time risk assessment. Every time the vehicle exceeds safe inclination thresholds, alerts are sent both to fleet managers via a web application and to drivers through in-vehicle messaging systems, enhancing safety and enabling proactive interventions. Additionally, designed the Behavior Driving Score, a dynamic scoring system that penalizes poor driving practices and rewards good behavior. The model accounts for different vehicle usage patterns, ensuring fair assessments while promoting safer and more efficient driving habits.</p>

                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">ANBIMA Data Steward, Fraud and Outlier Detection</h3>
                <p>Led the design and implementation of a proprietary data quality auditing system for ANBIMA, leveraging the ANBIMA DATA platform. This involved curating datasets in earlier stages of the project and deploying an ECOD (Empirical Cumulative Outlier Detection) methodology to identify discrepancies in large-scale financial data. The system generated a Data Quality Bulletin, enabling compliance by auditing critical metrics and preventing errors in official reports and company disclosures. This solution, akin to IBM's InfoSphere, was tailored to ANBIMA's specific requirements and integrated directly into their workflow, ensuring reliable data pipelines and actionable insights for high-stakes decision-making.</p>

                <p>Implemented advanced credit risk modeling techniques, achieving a <strong>15% reduction in delinquency rates</strong> by integrating external risk data and deploying machine learning models. The project involved developing a robust data pipeline to merge internal portfolio information with external sources such as SELIC rates, ensuring comprehensive risk assessment and accurate predictions. Advanced algorithms were implemented to identify high-risk "offender groups" through correlation analysis and aggregation by dimensions such as age, salary, and payment methods, enabling targeted mitigation strategies. Ensemble predictive models, including ARIMA and LSTM, were used to forecast delinquency indicators over multiple time horizons, such as over30mob and over60mob, allowing proactive management of portfolio risks.</p>
